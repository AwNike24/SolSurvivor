        <p>
          Unlike most "bracket-based" pools, this is a single elimination
          tournament. Select one team each day of the tournament (not each
          round). You need to select four teams in the first round. If you win,
          you move on. If you lose, you’re eliminated. There are no point
          spreads. If you survive all the way through the final game, you will
          have made 12 correct selections.

          <b>
            Remember, once you've picked a team, you cannot use them again.
          </b>
          Last person (or people) surviving win (or split) 90% of the pot.

        <p>
          If you are a captain, you can keep creating as many as you would like

        </p>
        <p>
          If you are not a captain and want to make multiple entries, you will
          need tell your captain how many entries you would like and he/she can
          add it to your account. You will only be automatically assigned 1
          entry from your captain.

          <b>
            Scoring will be based on the number of rounds survived, not number
            of games won.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          If multiple entries lose in the same round, they will all be treated
          the same regardless if they won more games in that round. For example,
          in the elite 8 I select 2 teams. The first one wins but my second team
          loses. The other competitors all select losing team with their first
          pick. Even though you won more games, you did not advance past the
          elite 8, and therefore would split the prize pool with everyone who
          also was eliminated in the elite 8.
        </p>

          >In the event there are ten or more winners, a tie-breaker will take
          effect. The tie-breaker is as follows:
        </b>
        <p>
          The end-of-pool tiebreaker is designed to reward those survivors who
          took a more difficult path to the finish line. In the event there are
          ten or more winners, a tie-breaker will take effect. The tie-breaker
          will be the sum of the seeds selected throughout the tournament. The
          ten survivors with the highest sum will split the pot. It will be
          possible to have more than ten winners in our tie-breaker if they
          share the same sum of the seeds. The "sum of the seeds" is determined
          by adding the seeds of all of your selections. A number 16 seed that
          wins is worth 16 points. A number one seed that wins is worth one
          point.

        COVID RULES:
        <li>
          If a team has to forfeit OR advances as a result of a no-contest, the
          game will <b> NOT </b> count toward the pool. That means you will have
          to pick another team in order to advance.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you picked a team that either forfeits or advances without a game
          being played, and you don’t pick another team, you will be eliminated.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a game is POSTPONED, it will still count toward the pool if it is
          <b> finished </b> BEFORE any games from the next round are started. If
          a game you picked is postponed and is finished after the next round
          starts, you will be eliminated.
        </li>
        <b> Please note </b>, you will always be able to change your entry
        before the game starts. If a game is postponed your entry will not be
        locked.
